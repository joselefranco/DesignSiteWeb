    <p>The guitar history can be traced back over 4000 years, making it an ancient instrument. Even if it has often been claimed that the guitar is a development of the lute, or even of the ancient Greek kithara some research done by Dr. Michael Kasha showed that the lute is a result of a separate line of development, sharing common ancestors with the guitar, but having had no influence on its evolution. <strong>While the only evidence for the theory for the Greek kithara is the similarity between the greek word and the Spanish word "guitarra"</strong>.
      <br/>
      <br/>
To distinguish guitars from other members of the tanbur family, a guitar is defined as having "a long, fretted neck, flat wooden soundboard, ribs, and a flat back, most often with incurved sides" .
<br/>
<br/>
The oldest known iconographical representation of an instrument displaying all the essential features of a guitar is a stone carving at Alaca Huyuk in Turkey, of a 3300 year old Hittite "guitar" with "a long fretted neck, flat top, probably flat back, and with strikingly incurved sides".
<br/>
<br/>
The name "guitar" comes from the ancient Sanskrit words for "string" - "tar" and "chatur" (or persian “char”) which means four Many stringed folk instruments exist in Central Asia to this day which have been used in almost unchanged form for several thousand years, as shown by archeological finds in the area.
<br/>
<br/>
The earliest stringed instruments known to archaeologists are bowl harps made in prehistory by using tortoise shells and calabashes as resonators and tanburs which are defined as "long-necked stringed instruments with a small egg- or pear-shaped body, with an arched or round back, usually with a soundboard of wood or hide, and a long, straight neck".
<br/>
<br/>
Tomb paintings and stone carvings in Egypt testify to the fact that harps and tanburs (together with flutes and percussion instruments) were being played in ensemble 3500 - 4000 years ago. Archaeologists have also found many similar relics in the ruins of the ancient Persian and Mesopotamian cultures. <strong>Many of these instruments have survived into modern times in almost unchanged form</strong>, as witness the folk instruments of the region like the Turkish saz, Balkan tamburitsa, Iranian setar, Afghan panchtar and Greek bouzouki.

          <p>At 3500 years old, the oldest preserved guitar-like instrument, belonged to the Egyptian singer Har-Mose. He was buried with his tanbur close to the tomb of his employer, Sen-Mut, architect to Queen Hatshepsut. Har-Moses instrument had three strings and a plectrum suspended from the neck by a cord. The soundbox was made of polished cedarwood and had a rawhide "soundboard". It can be seen today at the Archaeological Museum in Cairo.</p>

          <p>Tanburs and harps spread around the ancient world with travellers, merchants and seamen. The four-stringed Persian chartar arrived in Spain, where it changed in form and construction and acquired pairs of unison-tuned strings instead of single strings and became known as the quitarra or chitarra.
            <br/>
            <br/>
By the beginning of the Renaissance, the four-course (4 unison-tuned pairs of strings) guitar had become dominant, at least in most of Europe. (Sometimes a single first string was used.) <strong>The earliest known music for the four-course "chitarra" was written in 16th century Spain</strong>. The five-course guitarra battente, first appeared in Italy at around the same time, and gradually replaced the four-course instrument. The standard tuning had already settled at A, D, G, B, E, like the top five strings of the modern guitar.
<br/>
<br/>
In common with lutes, early guitars seldom had necks with more than 8 frets free of the body, but as the guitar evolved, this increased first to 10 and then to 12 frets to the body.
<br/>
<br/>
A sixth course of strings was added to the Italian "guitarra battente" in the 17th century, and guitar makers all over Europe followed the trend. The six-course arrangement gradually gave way to six single strings, and it seems that the Italians were the driving force. (The six-string guitar can thus be said to be a development of the twelve-string, rather than vice versa, as is usually assumed.)
<br/>
<br/>
In the transition from five courses to six single strings, at least some existing five-course instruments were modified to the new stringing pattern, an ornate guitar by the German master from Hamburg, Joaquim Thielke (1641 - 1719), was altered in this way.

    <p>At the beginning of the 19th century one can see the modern guitar beginning to take shape. Bodies were still fairly small and narrow-waisted.
      <br/>
      <br/>
    <strong>The modern "classical" guitar took its present form when the Spanish maker Antonio Torres increased the size of the body, altered its proportions, and introduced the revolutionary "fan" top bracing pattern, in around 1850. His design radically improved the volume, tone and projection of the instrument, and very soon became the accepted construction standard</strong>. It has remained essentially unchanged, and unchallenged, to this day. At around the same time, German immigrants to the USA - among them Christian Friedrich Martin - had begun making guitars with X-braced tops. Steel strings first became widely available in around 1900. Steel strings offered the promise of much louder guitars, but the increased tension was too much for the Torres-style fan-braced top. A beefed-up X-brace proved equal to the job, and quickly became the industry standard for the flat-top steel string guitar.</p>

At the end of the 19th century Orville Gibson was building archtop guitars with oval sound holes. He married the steel-string guitar with a body constructed more like a cello, where the bridge exerts no torque on the top, only pressure straight down. This allows the top to vibrate more freely, and thus produce more volume. <strong>In the early 1920's designer Lloyd Loar joined Gibson, and refined the archtop "jazz" guitar into its now familiar form with f-holes, floating bridge and cello-type tailpiece</strong>.

        The electric guitar was born when pickups were added to Hawaiian and "jazz" guitars in the late 1920's, but met with little success before 1936, when Gibson introduced the ES150 model, which Charlie Christian made famous.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>With the advent of amplification it became possible to do away with the sound box altogether. In the late 1930's and early 1940's several actors were experimenting along these lines, and controversy still exists as to whether Les Paul, Leo Fender, Paul Bigsby or O.W. Appleton constructed the very first solid-body guitar. But one thing’s for sure: the solid-body electric guitar was here to stay</strong>.

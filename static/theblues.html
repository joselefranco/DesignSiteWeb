    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p><strong>Blues</strong> is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs, spirituals, and folk music. Blues <strong>incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads</strong>.
<br/>
<br/>
      The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or "worried notes"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. <strong>Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove</strong>.

          <h3>Robert Johnson</h3>
          <p>Robert Leroy Johnson (May 8, 1911 – August 16, 1938) was an American blues singer-songwriter and musician. His landmark recordings in 1936 and 1937 display a combination of singing, guitar skills, and songwriting talent that has influenced later generations of musicians. Johnson's shadowy and poorly documented life and death at age 27 have given rise to much legend. <strong>One Faustian myth says that he sold his soul to the devil at a local crossroads of Mississippi highways to achieve success</strong>. As an itinerant performer who played mostly on street corners, in juke joints, and at Saturday night dances, Johnson had little commercial success or public recognition in his lifetime.
            <br/>
            <br/>
After the reissue of his recordings in 1961, on the LP King of the Delta Blues Singers, his work reached a wider audience. Johnson is now recognized as a master of the blues, particularly of the Mississippi Delta blues style. He is credited by many rock musicians as an important influence; <strong>the blues and rock musician Eric Clapton has called Johnson "the most important blues singer that ever lived."</strong>
<br/>
<br/>
Johnson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in its first induction ceremony, in 1986, as an early influence on rock and roll. In 2003, David Fricke ranked Johnson fifth in <strong><i>Rolling Stone</i></strong> magazine's "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".</p>

    <h3>Blind Willie Johnson</h3>
  <p>Blind Willie Johnson (January 25, 1897 – September 18, 1945) was an American gospel blues singer and guitarist and evangelist. <strong>His landmark recordings completed between 1927 and 1930—thirty songs in total—display a combination of powerful "chest voice" singing, slide guitar skills, and originality that has influenced later generations of musicians</strong>. Even though Johnson's records sold well, as a street performer and preacher he had little wealth in his lifetime. His life was poorly documented, but over time music historians such as Samuel Charters have uncovered more about Johnson and his five recording sessions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
  A revival of interest in Johnson's music began in the 1960s, following his inclusion on Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, and by the efforts of the blues guitarist Reverend Gary Davis. Johnson's work has become more accessible through compilation albums such as Blind Willie Johnson 1927–1930 and The Complete Willie Johnson, both spearheaded by Charters. <strong>As a result, Johnson is credited as one of the most influential practitioners of the blues, and his slide guitar playing, particularly on his hymn "Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground", is highly acclaimed</strong>. Other recordings by Johnson include "Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed", "It's Nobody's Fault but Mine", and "John the Revelator".

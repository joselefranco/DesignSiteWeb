    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p><strong>Blues rock</strong> is a fusion genre combining elements of blues and rock. It is mostly an electric ensemble-style music with instrumentation similar to electric blues and rock. From its beginnings in the early- to mid-1960s, blues rock has gone through several stylistic shifts and along the way inspired hard rock, Southern rock, and heavy metal. Blues rock continues to be an influence, with performances and recordings by several popular artists.
<br/>
<br/>
Blues rock started with rock musicians in the United Kingdom and the United States performing American blues songs. <strong>They typically recreated electric Chicago-style blues songs, such as those by Muddy Waters, Jimmy Reed, Howlin' Wolf, and Albert King, at faster tempos and with a more aggressive sound common to rock</strong>.
<br/>
<br/>
In the UK, the style was popularized by groups such as the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, and the Animals, who managed to place blues songs into the pop charts. In the US, Lonnie Mack, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, and Canned Heat were among the earliest exponents and "attempted to play long, involved improvisations which were commonplace on jazz records". John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers and Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac also developed this more instrumental, but traditional-based style in the UK, while late-1960s/early 1970s groups, including Ten Years After, Savoy Brown, and Foghat became more hard rock oriented. In the US, Johnny Winter, the Allman Brothers Band, and ZZ Top represented a hard rock trend.

          <h3>Led Zeppelin</h3>
          <p>
      Led Zeppelin is made up of four guys.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The late John Bonham, at the drums (also known as Bonzo or the human missile — I made that up), Jimmy Page on the guitar(s), John Paul Jones on bass guitar, keyboards (piano, synthesisers, organs) and Robert “Percy” Plant, the white-armoured singer with the sometimes (especially before 1973) angelic voice.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Jimmy Page was a session guitarist in London in the 1960s. He was hired by producers to play some guitar parts, sometimes replacing original band members because they were too wasted or something. When Jeff Beck left the Yardbirds, Jimmy took lead guitar.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Soon, the Yardbirds decomposed. Not to worry, Jimmy Page had another musical project in mind.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      A trend in 1968 was for hard rock (listen to the beautiful record Beck-O-La by the Jeff Beck Group). Jimmy wanted balance.
      Something between light (acoustic music, Californian soft rock) and shade (Jeff Beck’s hard rock). Music that would masterfully employ dynamics (the relative “loudness” of music, like p for piano and ff for fortissimo).
      <br/>
      <br/>
      But for this quest, Page needed companions.</p>

      <h3>Why is Led Zeppelin's music so great?</h3>
        <br/>
      <h4>Excellence & synergy</h4>
<p>When you listen to a Zeppelin song, you can let your mind wander and focus on each instrument individually, including the vocals. The production is still sounding very modern, thanks to Jimmy Page’s impeccable technique.
    <br/>
    <br/>
The variation in the guitar sounds is sometimes very subtle, but there’s always a difference. Not two bars are the same on When The Levee Breaks, for instance.
<br/>
<br/>
Robert’s singing, especially in the early days (69–72) was agile and to the point. But you already know too much about Jimmy and Robert, the genius also lies in the rhythmic section of the band.
<br/>
<br/>
<h4>The Drums</h4>
<br/>
Before Led Zeppelin, most bands used to “crush” the drums’ sound. John Bonham, with his ferocious and thunderous attack (he was a big guy who was building buildings, unlike other rock drummers) had a distinctive sound. Everyone recognises Led Zeppelin when they hear the first seconds of “When The Levee Breaks”. Bonham used the biggest kick drum and the biggest sticks possible. He had an amazingly deft touch and inhuman time-keeping abilities. He could alternate between intense attacks and softer taps (listen to the transition in The Lemon Song).
<br/>
<br/>
His passion for funk and soul records made his drumming style quite groovy, unlike other hard rock bands. It’s a passion he shared with the other member of the rhythmic section, Led Zeppelin’s bassist John Paul Jones. This is why girls were dancing in Zeppelin concerts and weren’t dancing in Black Sabbath’s or Iron Butterfly’s concerts. Jimmy recognised Bonham’s uniqueness and made the drums a central instrument in the music of Led Zeppelin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
<h4>The Bass</h4>

<br/>
Jimmy Page, in addition to being the founder and lead guitarist, was the producer. This means he chose which track to lay where and how when mixing. Jimmy, recognising an equivalent talent in John Paul Jones, often mixed the bass track’s volume a tad higher than the guitar track. This is why you can hear the bass so well on Zeppelin’s records. The bass is the bridge between rhythm and melody. It’s the binding sound of rock music. Hearing it clearly, as performed by a virtuoso delivers great pleasure.
<br/>
<br/>
Most importantly, while Robert and Jimmy were generous in their games while they were playing, John Paul was more of a teaser. The placement of some of his notes is brilliant. I’m thinking about the bass in The Rain Song, about the piano in D’yer Maker.
<br/>
<br/>
<h4>Performance</h4>
<br/>

I get my Zeppelin highs from listening to them play live. This is where you can really hear the inhuman connection there is between them. In the early days, they were as tight as Robert’s jeans.
<br/>
<br/>
None of their songs would be the same when they would play them live. The raw energy is captivating. Their best live album is thankfully available legally, it’s called How The West Was Won. You should listen carefully and hear how amazingly well they play together. Especially Going to California (Jimmy and John Paul on the electric mandolin) or Bring It On Home (Jimmy and John Paul, then Jimmy and Bonzo).
<br/>
<br/>
They were insanely resistant as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Most of their concerts lasted more than two hours. In the beginning, they would play old-time rock and roll songs because their meagre repertoire did not suffice and the crowd would not let them leave. They could play 27 minutes of Whole Lotta Love with medleys and directly start playing another song right after. They could keep a rhythm (listen to John Paul playing the same riff on the bass for 4 minutes straight on Dazed and Confused live).
Such quality of performance is viscerally satisfying and rather unique, especially when you’ve been listening to these songs since you were a kid.
<br/>
<br/>
<h4>Communion</h4>
<br/>
This is, to me, the factor that makes Led Zeppelin really stand out.
Each concert was a communion between the musicians and the crowd. Of course, everyone was tripping on hard shit. We still see that nowadays. But basically, it went like this: Jimmy is fucking Robert with his guitar and Robert moans accordingly. The rest of the crowd mentally undresses Robert with determination. The intensity of the communion was thus sexual. You can still feel it decades after (or maybe I’m crazy).
<br/>
<br/>
It could boil down to one song, Dazed and Confused.
<br/>
<br/>
The most satanic bass line you’ll ever hear would start the song that often lasted more than 20 minutes when played live (7 minutes for the studio version, the longest was 45 minutes at their Earls Court concert).
The song starts quite energetically and then, at some point, the music stops, Jimmy takes a violin bow and starts toying with his guitar. At this point, it’s like he is calling demons. The song becomes frightening. It’d send shivers down your spine. I would imagine the crowd, tripping hard, must have felt quite bad at this point in the song.
<br/>
<br/>
Not to worry.
<br/>
<br/>
Led Zeppelin were the guardians of people’s trips. They’d make you feel really bad and then, suddenly, the bass and the drums come rescuing you with power and rhythm (see this text by William Burroughs on the matter).

<h3>Jimi Hendrix</h3>

    <p>Born in 1942, in Seattle, Washington, Jimi Hendrix learned to play guitar as a teenager and grew up to become a rock legend who excited audiences in the 1960s with his innovative electric guitar playing. One of his most memorable performances was at Woodstock in 1969, where he performed "The Star Spangled Banner." Hendrix died in 1970 from drug-related complications, leaving his mark on the world of rock music and remaining popular to this day.</p>

<h4>Little Wings</h4>
<br/>
Jimi Hendrix was born Johnny Allen Hendrix (later changed by his father to James Marshall) on November 27, 1942, in Seattle, Washington. He had a difficult childhood, sometimes living in the care of relatives and even acquaintances at times.
<br/>
<br/>
His mother, Lucille, was only 17 years old when Hendrix was born. She had a stormy relationship with his father, Al, and eventually left the family after the couple had two more children together, sons Leon and Joseph. Hendrix would only see his mother sporadically before her death in 1958.
<br/>
<br/>
<h4>Jimmy James</h4>
<br/>
In many ways, music became a sanctuary for Hendrix. He was a fan of blues and rock and roll, and with his father's encouragement taught himself to play guitar. When Hendrix was 16, his father bought him his first acoustic, and the next year his first electric guitar—a right-handed Supro Ozark that the natural lefty had to flip upside down to play. Shortly thereafter, he began performing with his band, the Rocking Kings. In 1959, he dropped out of high school and worked odd jobs while continuing to follow his musical aspirations.
<br/><br/>
In 1961, Hendrix followed in his father's footsteps by enlisting in the United States Army. While training as a paratrooper, Hendrix still found time for music, forming a band named the King Kasuals. Hendrix served in the army until 1962, when he was honorably discharged after injuring himself during a parachute jump.
<br/><br/>
After leaving the military, Hendrix began working under the name Jimmy James as a session musician, playing backup for such performers as Little Richard, B.B. King, Sam Cooke and the Isley Brothers. In 1965 he also formed a group of his own called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, which played gigs around New York City's Greenwich Village neighborhood.
<br/><br/>
<h4>The Jimi Hendrix Experience</h4>
<br/>
In mid-1966, Hendrix met Chas Chandler—bass player of British rock group the Animals—who signed an agreement with Hendrix to become his manager. Chandler convinced Hendrix to go to London, where he joined forces with bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell to form the Jimi Hendrix Experience.
<br/><br/>
While performing in England, Hendrix built up quite a following among the country's rock royalty, with the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who and Eric Clapton all becoming great admirers of his work. One critic for the British music magazine Melody Maker said that he "had great stage presence" and looked at times as if he were playing "with no hands at all."
<br/><br/>
Released in 1967, the Jimi Hendrix Experience's first single, "Hey Joe," was an instant smash in Britain and was soon followed by hits such as "Purple Haze" and "The Wind Cries Mary." On tour to support his first album, Are You Experienced? (1967), Hendrix delighted audiences with his outrageous guitar playing skills and his innovative, experimental sound. In June 1967 he also won over American music fans with his stunning performance at the Monterey Pop Festival, which ended with Hendrix lighting his guitar on fire.
<br/><br/>
<h4>Bold as Love</h4>
<br/>
Quickly becoming a rock superstar, later that year Hendrix scored again with his second album, Axis: Bold as Love (1967). His final album as part of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Electric Ladyland (1968), featured the hit "All Along the Watchtower," which was written by Bob Dylan. The band continued to tour until it split up in 1969.
<br/><br/>
That same year, Hendrix performed at another legendary musical event: the Woodstock Festival. Hendrix, the last performer to appear in the three-day-plus festival, opened his set with a rock rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner" that amazed the crowds and demonstrated his considerable talents as a musician. Also an accomplished songwriter and producer by this time, Hendrix had his own recording studio, Electric Lady, in which he worked with different performers to try out new songs and sounds.
<br/><br/>
In late 1969, Hendrix put together a new group, forming Band of Gypsys with his army buddy Billy Cox and drummer Buddy Miles. The band never really took off, however, and Hendrix began working on a new album tentatively named First Rays of the New Rising Sun, with Cox and Mitch Mitchell. Sadly, Hendrix would not live to complete the project.
<br/><br/>
<h4>The Wind Cries Mary</h4>
<br/>
On September 18, 1970, Hendrix died in London from drug-related complications. While this talented recording artist was only 27 years old at the time of his passing, he left his indelible mark on the world of rock music and remains popular to this day. As one journalist wrote in the Berkeley Tribe, "Jimi Hendrix could get more out of an electric guitar than anyone else. He was the ultimate guitar player."
